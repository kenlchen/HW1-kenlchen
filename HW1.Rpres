First Slide
========================================================

Before running this presentation, you will need to 
 - set the current directory in the console (go to session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location)
 - run the following commands which take up time
    - source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    - biocLite()
    - getSQLiteFile() Note: this will take some time

SQL database query
========================================================

```{r}
library(GEOmetadb)
geo_con <- dbConnect(SQLite(),'GEOmetadb.sqlite')
dbGetQuery(geo_con, "SELECT gse.title, gse.gse, gpl.gpl, gpl.manufacturer, gpl.description FROM (gse JOIN gse_gpl ON gse.gse = gse_gpl.gse) j JOIN gpl ON j.gpl = gpl.gpl WHERE gse.title LIKE '%HCV%' AND gse.contact LIKE '%yale%' AND gpl.manufacturer LIKE '%Illumina%';")
```

Output should look like
